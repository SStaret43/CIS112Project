### **Thoughts & Future Plans**

#### This project was created with the intent to be a simulation of a railway management system. In its current state, I feel as though this could realistically be implemented as a simplistic application that effectively manages a railway system and all of its components. Obviously, the program still needs to be worked on in order for it to properly function as an actual software program that could control even the most basic railway system. Here is a shortlist of what I will do in the future:
   * ##### fix backend issues in SQL leading to relationships not working properly
   * ##### implement needed methods to avoid repetitive code
   * ##### create classes to house methods so code is more organized and readable
   * ##### add CSS to UI to make it more professional and aesthetic
   * ##### *possibly* move UI to the web
